\section*{Purpose}
\label{sec:purpose}

The purpose of this document is to describe the project at hand.
The purpose of the project is to demonstrate the applicability of the
certified security by design approach using access-control logic (ACL)
and the higher order logic (HOL) theorem prover to a project of the
size and type of the patrol base. [Add stuff about how this could be
used in stuff that Jesse spoke of. Or, if Jesse is not cooperating,
ask professor Chin.]

\section*{Limitations}
\label{sec:limitations}
This project has no limitations other than the time needed to represent
the design phase of the project in the access-control logic (ACL) and
implement that in the higher order logic (HOL) theorem prover.

\section*{Scope}
\label{sec:scope}

This document describes the how the patrol base was represented as state
machines and then implemented in the access-control logic (ACL) and higher
order logic (HOL). Professor Shiu-Kai Chin is the Principal Investigator
and is responsible for the project as a whole. Jesse Nathaniel Hall is the
subject matter aspect. Lori Pickering is the access-control logic (ACL)
and higher order logic (HOL) expert. YiHong Guo assists with organizing
the documentation. This documentation is organized similarly to how the
project unfolded. Jesse and I came together to figure out how to represent
the patrol base. We decided on a state machine approach to organizing the
information in the patrol base. After this initial phase, we each worked
separately, Jesse on translating the patrol base into state machine and
Lori into implementing this into ACL and HOL, coming together occasionally
to clarify areas as necessary.

The METHODS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND PROCEDURES Section is divided into three
sections: 3.1 Overall Approach; 3.2 Design; and 3.3 Implementation. Section
3.1 focuses primarily on the initiation of the project. Sections 3.2 and
3.3 discuss the design and implementation phase, respectively, from the
person who knows that section the best.

The RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS section is separated into 3 parts, similarly to
section 3. This section shows the results of the METHODS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND
PROCEDURES. Section 4.2 includesâ€¦[description based on what Jesse did]. It
includes a step-by-step walk through one of the secure state machine
implementations in HOL in section 4.3.

The Conclusions section contains recommendations for future work in both the
design phase (section 5.2.1) and the implementation phase (section 5.2.2).
5.1 contains discussions about the project in general.
