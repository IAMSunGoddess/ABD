\ \\\ \\\ \\\\\\ \ \ \ \ \ Platoon patrol base (PB) operations are an
essential part of many military
operations. They provide Soldiers with a means to avoid enemy contact, rest,
resupply, and conduct Squad level missions (Ranger Handbook 2011, 132).
Although some might believe that a PB begins from an objective rally point
(ORP), a PB must be planned for. Our PB software includes a state machine
model for tasks that include planning, movement, as well as conducting both
an ORP and PB.
