\label{sec:overall-approach}


\section{Design Phase}
\label{sec:design-phase}

\ \ \ \ The doctrine reflected in our project was taken from the Ranger Handbook
(Ranger Handbook 2011). Our first task was to reflect a patrol base (PB)
in two-dimensional form so that we could analyze possible courses of action
with regard to modularizing and parameterizing PB operations. Microsoft\textregistered
Powerpoint was used for the initial sketches, which provided a visual
reference for the entire PB from planning through actual withdrawal from
the PB (see figure 3.1). The reasoning behind inclusion of a planning state
was that our entire project was based on ensuring the proper execution of
a PB, and proper execution begins with planning.\ \\\\

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{map31.png}
  \caption{PB Phase Overview}
\end{figure}
After the PB was broken into phases, we began creating states that mimicked
the phases outlined in the Powerpoint\textcopyright document (figure 3.1). Microsoft\textregistered
Visio was used to illustrate the states, their order, and the commands that
initiated movement from one state to another (figure 3.2). The decision to
adopt a state machine as the method for rendering PB operations came from
previous projects Dr. Shiu-Kai Chin had allowed our team to review. Projects
programmed in Poly Meta Language (Poly/ML) and compiled with High Order
Logic (HOL) seemed to lend themselves well to the state machine structure.\\ \\

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{map32.png}
  \caption{PB Top Level States Overview}
\end{figure}
The states were organized into discrete subtasks, illustrated in figure 3.2
with blue circles and the state’s name in the center. Each state had easily
discernable actions for entering and exiting the state, given above the line
connecting adjacent states. For simplicity, the majority of commands were
just named after the state that would be initiated when the command was given
(i.e. moveToPB initiates the MOVE_TO_PB state), with the exceptions of the
PLAN_PB state which would be initiated by Higher Head Quarters (HHQ) when they
transmitted an operations order (OPORD) and the MOVE_TO_ORP state which would be
initiated by the command given by the Platoon Leader (PL) to cross the line of
departure (LD).\\\\
Each state was given a loop, labeled “incomplete,” which would simply
allow the Platoon time to execute the tasks associated with each state.\\\\
We recognized that the state machine we initially designed, here after
referred to as top-level state machine, required alternate states that
would represent conclusions other than a successful completion of a PB.
Three scenarios were derived:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Platoon received a new mission.
\item The Platoon came under attack.
\item The Platoon was rendered non-mission capable (NMC) by either
  casualty (i.e. too many Soldiers fell ill or died), or lack of supplies.
\end{enumerate}
States corresponding to these scenarios were developed: “change mission,”
“react to contact,” and “return to base” respectively (illustrated in figure
3.3 with red circles). At any state in the PB top-level state machine, save
for the “complete” state which represents a successful PB operation, these
alternate termination states could be reached and essentially terminate the
machines execution (see figure 3.3).\\
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.36]{map33.png}
  \caption{PB Top Level Alternate States Overview}
\end{figure}\\
Each of the top-level states represented a number of explicit tasks that
we extrapolated from the Ranger Handbook (Ranger Handbook 2011):
\begin{itemize}
\item The planning state for the PB (PLAN_PB) contained sub states
  corresponding to the “Troop Leading Procedures” (TLPs) outlined in
  chapter 2 section 1 of the Ranger Handbook (Ranger Handbook 2011, 23).
\item Movement to the objective rally point (MOVE_TO_ORP) sub
  states were crafted from chapter 6 (Ranger Handbook 2011, 101).
\item Sub states corresponding to the were found in chapter 7,
  section 20 (Ranger Handbook 2011, 131).
\item “Move to PB” sub states were formed similarly to those in “move to ORP.”
\item “Conduct PB” sub states were outlined by chapter 7 as well, section 21
  (Ranger Handbook 2011, 132).
\end{itemize}
From this we were able to develop sub states for each of the top-level
states (see figure 3.4).\\
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{map34.png}
  \caption{PB Sub States Overview}
\end{figure}\\
These sub states (shown in light blue in figure 3.4) not only provided a
finer granularity to the tasks within the PB, but also introduced new leadership
roles. The top-level state machine was controlled by only the PL, the sub state
machine had states that were initiated by the PL and the Platoon Sergeant (PSG)
(see figure 3.4).\\ \\
The sub states within the top-level state PLAN_PB presented another interesting
characteristic: according to the Ranger Handbook section 2-1 many of the states
could be executed in any order (Ranger Handbook 2011, 23). Specifically, out of
the eight steps to the TLP, the last five (see figure 3.5) (Ranger Handbook 2011,
23).\\
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=.255]{map35.png}
  \caption{TLP Steps}
\end{figure}\\
We decided on a more logical, and smaller scale, approach. Issuing a complete order,
step 6, would require that the PL had already done the recon and used terrain analysis
to provide a complete plan. In the same regard, issuing a complete order, step 7,
requires that you have completed step 6. Consequently, there were only three states
within the top-level state PLAN_PB that would be allowed to initiate and terminate
out of order: TENTATIVE_PLAN, INITIATE_MOVEMENT, and RECON corresponding to the TLP
steps 3-5. These steps are outlined in orange in figure 3.6 below.\\

\section{Implementation Phase}
\label{sec:implementation-phase}

The implementation phase involved translating the design phase into the access-control
logic (ACL) and implementing this in the higher order logic (HOL). This was the certified
security by design part of the project. The idea was to design security into the system from
the start, at the design phase, rather than finding loop-holes at a later time and patching
things up in a piece-wise manner. Translating the design into the access-control logic and
then verifying this using the HOL, ensured that the design of the system met the requirements
of security built into the design phase. With this approach, HOL could point to problems
early-on which could be remedied before the system itself was implemented.

\subsection{The Implementation Approach}
\label{sec:impl-appr}

The goal was to represent the patrol base in a way that would be amiable to applying
access-control logic (ACL) principles. The motive for this project was, in fact, to
demonstrate the applicability of these principles to the mission assurance objective.
Representing the patrol base in terms of state machines was easily implemented with
computer-aided reasoning, in this case the HOL higher order logic theorem prover. The
basic idea was to establish states, commands to transition from one state to another,
and people who were authorized to make these commands. To do this, it was first necessary
to translate the patrol base into discrete states. This was where the subject matter
expertise of Jesse was crucial. The details were described in the section “add section title here.”

\subsection{Hierachy of State Machines}
\label{sec:hier-state-mach}

In this project, we decided on a hierarchy of state machines with a top-level state machine,
sub-level state machines, and sub-sub-level state machines, etc. as the foundational approach.
That is, we began with a top-level state machine consisting of 6 states. Each state (save for
the terminal state) was yet another state machine at a sub-level. We called this a sub-level
state machine. There was one sub-level state machine for each state in the top-level state machine.
This produced at pyramid-like, top down structure. Adding yet another level, the sub-sub-level,
produced a state machine for each state machine in the higher-up sub-level state machine. These
were called the sub-sub-level state machines. Beyond this level, we considered alternative
approaches. Although we discussed and worked out some strategies here, the project was simply
too large for one summer. These ideas are discussed in the “Future Work” section.\\

The reason for this pyramid-like approach was multi-fold.
\begin{itemize}
\item First, it was logical to look at the patrol base as a whole and design a basic,
  top-level state machine that represented the most basic states. Going into too much
  detail at first would be distracting and thus error-prone.
\item Second, this approach facilitated a test of the state machine approach before
  going into too much depth. It was easy to see at the top-level what would work and
  what would not work.
\item Third, it allowed for separation of tasks. Jesse’s expertise was in his knowledge
  of the patrol base and his ability to work with Visio and other similar technologies.
  Lori’s expertise was in her knowledge of the access-control logic (ACL) principles and
  her ability to work with the higher order logic (HOL) theorem prover. Once a top-level
  state machine was established, Jesse continued work on the delineation of the patrol base
  into state machines while Lori began work on implementing the state machine(s) using the
  ACL principals and HOL.
\item Fourth, the modularization facilitated the concept of separation of implementation.
  For example, if someone were to take the top-level state machine and delegate the sub-level
  state machines to others, then they could all be integrated together at a later time. The
  same could be said at the sub-level, and so on. The idea of integration is discussed further
  in the “Future Works” section.
\item Fifth, approaching the project one level at a time facilitated a step-by-step approach
  to solving each new level of complexity while capitalizing on previous successes. Because of
  the nature of HOL, once we solved one problem in the implementation of the patrol base, we could
  rely on that solution. The next problem could then be isolated and attacked without back-tracking—
  for the most part. We could add complexity as we approached it, in analogy to the complexity of
  detail in the patrol base itself.
\item Sixth, time constraints on the project were tight. As we delved into the sub-level
  and sub-sub-level state machines, the level of detail that needed to be implemented in the
  ACL and HOL became apparent. The outlooks for the project were exciting. And, at the same time,
  we realized that a complete implementation of the patrol base in HOL would require more than one
  summer. Thus, the level-by-level approach facilitated a view of what could be done based on
  what had been done, demonstrating the practicality of the application of ACL and HOL to a patrol
  base-like problem. This was our goal.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Secure State Machine}
\label{sec:secure-state-machine}

Again, the reason for the state machine approach was that it was the simplest way to represent a
large project using ACL and implement it using HOL. If the patrol base was represented as a state
machine, then the orders/commands could be represented as inputs into the states. This was what we
did. We determined at each level, what should be considered a state and what order/command should
be given to transition from that state to the next. For a basic state machine, this was all that
was needed to represent the given level of complexity. However, in general, we were concerned with
authentication and authorization. Who was giving the command and did that person have the authority
to give that command? Thus, we needed the appropriate checks on identity (authentication) and authority
to make the transition from one state to another. We needed not just a state machine but a secure
state machine.\\

For a secure state machine, we hiked up the complexity of our state machine model. We now only allowed
a transition from one state to another if the order was given by someone (or something) that was
authenticated and authorized. We called that someone (or something) in the access-control logic (ACL)
a “principal.” For example, we authenticate (via visual recognition) a soldier as the platoon leader.
We establish a priori that the platoon leader had the authority to command a change from one state
to another. Given those conditions, we wanted our state machine to make that change. More specifically,
assume we were in the planning phase of the patrol base. We called this the PLAN_PB state. (To be
consistent we denoted all states by capital letters.) In this state, the platoon leader said “cross
the line of discrimination.” We abbreviated this command as “crossLD”. (We used primarily lower-case
letters for commands.) Furthermore, we all knew that the platoon leader was authorized to give the
command to cross the line of discrimination and begin the next phase of the patrol base. We called this
next phase the MOVE_TO_ORP state. Under these circumstances, the access-control logic dictated that we
transition from the PLAN_PB state to the MOVE_TO_ORP state. We did this for each state, using the ACL
and HOL to verify the proper authentication and authority for each transition. This was the security by
design approach.

\subsection{Authentication}
\label{sec:authentication}

In the example above, the authentication of the principal (the platoon leader) was assumed to be
common knowledge. This was easy for soldiers who could verify the identity of an individual via visual
inspection or voice recognition. In the world of computers and/or wherein an individual was not known
(such as a security gate check-point or a computer terminal), more formal methods of authentication
were required. Although time constraints did not allow us to consider that for this project, the
applicability of the secure state machine approach had already been demonstrated elsewhere using
cryptographic functions, key cards, etc. This was also discussed in the “Future Work” section.\\

For the purposes of this project, the authenticated persons were listed in an authentication test
function. This function was a list of the form:
\begin{itemize}
\item Platoon Leader says “someCommand” = true,
\item Platoon Sergeant says “someCommand” = true,
\item Anything else = false.
\end{itemize}

Additional principals could have been listed or deleted as needed by each secure state machine.
Two principals were the maximum needed to the extent to which this project was implemented in HOL.
Most states required only one principal, namely the platoon leader. Each secure state machine had its
own authentication test function with its own list of principals. In the implementation, if a
principal other than those listed in the authentication test function were to make a request, HOL
would not allow the transition (or any other action) to occur.\\

The top-level state machine was implemented with only one principal, namely the platoon leader. In
other words, the platoon leader was responsible all that commands in the top-level state machine.
When the sub-level state machines were implemented, two state machines included two principals each
making commands, namely the platoon leader and the platoon sergeant. This caused some issues with HOL
because of the nature of the biconditional. If an authenticated and authorized principal gives the
command to change states then we proved in HOL that the transition should occur. On the converse, if
the transition occurred then we also proved in HOL that an authenticated and authorized principal must
have made the command. But, what if there were two authenticated and authorized principals? Which one
made the command? The problem wasn’t overly challenging; however, it did require a different strategy
than was used for the one principal secure state machines. The simplest approach was to allow each
principal to control a specific set of commands. Thus, there were platoon leader commands and platoon
sergeant commands. If a transition was made using a platoon leader command, then the platoon leader must
have made the command. The same was true for the platoon sergeant. The biconditional problem was solved.
Nevertheless, there were several other strategies which were explored and could have been implemented
in other secure state machines to demonstrate the flexibility of HOL.

\subsection{Authorization}
\label{sec:authorization}

In the ACL secure state machine approach, authentication was governed by a list of statements
dictating who “controls” what and under what conditions that control was governed. This was
essentially a list of trust assumptions, certificates, authorities, etc. For the level of complexity
that was implemented in this project, access was dictated by a prescribed security context list,
consisting of statements such as “Platoon Leader controls crossLD”. In other words, this was the
ACL representation of the policy stating that “the Platoon Leader has the authority to execute the
command “’crossLD’.” Of course, representation of the statement in HOL was more complex. Nevertheless,
it amounted to just this declaration of authority.\\

An additional level of complexity was added to the security context list of the ssmPlanPB state machine.
It was also planned for other state machines at the sub-sub-level. This was necessary as the complexity
of the project grew. In previously implemented secure state machines in the project,
transitions from one state to another
were sequential. To get from one state, the previous state must have been completed. For the
ssmPlanPB state machine, the transition from the WARNO state to the COMPLETE state was to occur
after the middle three states were completed. However, these states did not need to be completed
in any order. But, all three states had to be completed before transitioning to the COMPLETE state.
The easiest implementation approach involved allowing a list of inputs to the state machine. For
example, the transition from WARNO to COMPLETE was to occur only if a list of requests/commands,
say [a,b,c], was given as input, where each letter represented a request (i.e., a = Platoon Leader
says “state a is complete”). The order of this list was irrelevant. There were thus six permutations
of the list that could be passed as input to the state machine. It worked.\\

Nevertheless, the use of lists and permutations was not the most elegant solution and could cause
problems in integrating state machines later on (see “future work”). Thus, a second version of the
ssmPlanPB state machine was generated and named testssmPlanPB. This used the approach described next.\\

Consider the case wherein the Platoon Leader (or other principal) had the authority to execute a
command if and only if some set of conditions were met. For example, a, b, and c must have occur
before the command could be executed. a, b, and c could have been the following statements: Platoon
Leader says “state 2 is complete”; Platoon Sergeant says “state 3 is complete”; and Platoon Leader
says “state 4 is complete”. Under those conditions, we wanted the Platoon Leader to have the authority
to execute a change of state from WARNO to COMPLETE To do this in the ACL, a line in the security
context list would look like the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Platoon Leader says “state 2 is complete” and
\item Platoon Sergeant says “state 3 is complete” and
\item Platoon Leader says “state 4 is complete” implies
\item Platoon leader controls “complete”.
\end{itemize}
Thus, when the Platoon Leader says “complete”, our theorem prover would check the security
context list, check that all the conditions in the list were met, and then execute the transition
if and only if all conditions were met. This was the approach implemented in testssmPlanPB.\\

In addition, we knew because of the reliability of HOL that if the transition was executed, then
all of the said conditions above were met, namely.\\

If we are now in the state COMPLETE, then it is also true that
\begin{itemize}
\item Platoon Leader says “complete” is true (that is, the Platoon Leader made the request), and
\item Platoon Leader says “state 2 is complete” is true, and
\item Platoon Sergeant says “state 3 is complete” is true, and
  \item Platoon Leader says “state 4 is complete” is also true.
  \end{itemize}
  Other conditions could have been added and were discussed for future work.
  
\subsection{State Interpretation}
\label{sec:state-interpretation}

In addition to authentications and authorizations, the behavior of the state machine could have
been controlled by the definitions that were state-dependents. This approach was briefly considered,
in particular for the two-principal problem discussed above. However, time constraints favored the
simpler approach discussed. Nevertheless, it was worth mentioning and could be explored if the project
were to be extended.

\subsection{The Secure State Machine Model}
\label{sec:secure-state-machine-1}

For reasons pertaining to simplicity and experience, Professor Shiu-Kai Chin’s model of
a secure state machine was employed to implement a parameterizable secure state machine in
HOL. A few modifications were made by Lori Pickering. Parameterization allowed us to construct
a functioning secure state machine and then use that for all the secure state machines in our
project without re-proving recurring theorems. The secure state machine implementation was
implemented in the file ssm11Script.sml. This documentation referred to it as ssm11 or ssm11Theory.
ssm is an acronym for “secure state machine.” This nomenclature was used throughout this project
to indicate a secure state machine. For example, ssmPlanPB represented the “PlanPB” secure state
machine, which was implemented in the ssmPlanPBScript.sml file. Note that all “theory” files in
HOL were implemented in “nameScript.sml”. Once compiled with Holmake, they were included in
subsequent theories and definitions as “nameTheory”.\\

ssm11 had several functions that were necessary for the proper functioning of a secure state machine.
First, it defined the types of allowed transition:
\begin{itemize}
\item exec: execute a command.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item This happened if and only if the command was given by an authenticated and authorized principal.
    \end{itemize}
  \item trap: trap a command.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item This happened if and only if the command was given by an authenticated principal
      who was NOT authorized to give that command.
    \end{itemize}
  \item discard: discard the command.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item This happened if the principal was not authenticated. The command was also discarded
      if it was not properly formatted.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
  (The names were selected by Professor Shiu-Kai Chin and were chosen based on his research with
  virtual machines.)\\

  How did HOL know how to interpret the state of the state machine, the security context, the input,
  the output, the authentication test, and the state specific instructions? This was done by describing
  a configuration representing the current state of the machine. The configuration had the following
  components:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Authentication test function
  \item Security context list
  \item State interpretation function (state specific rules)
  \item Current state
  \item input
  \item output
  \end{itemize}
  The authentication test function, security context list, and state interpretation function were
  those described in the discussions above. The current state was simply the current state of the
  machine, before transition. The input was typically the request, i.e., “Platoon Leader says someCommand.”
  The output for this project was kept simple. The output for any transition was the name of the state
  of the machine after transition. To distinguish it from the state, the outputs were denoted by an
  initial capital letter followed by mostly lowercase letters, i.e., if the state machine transitioned
  from PLAN_PB to MOVE_TO_ORP then the output would be “MoveToORP.” The difference between names of
  outputs and names of inputs was that the input name because with a lowercase letter.\\

  In addition, HOL needed to know what the configuration meant with respect to the ACL and HOL logic. A
  configuration interpretation functions was also included in ssm11. This function combined everything
  into a list of ACL statements. HOL used these statements to prove things about the secure state machine.
  To do this, HOL needed an additional theory named satListTheory, which helped HOL to interpret lists
  in the ACL logic. This theory was written previously by Professor Shiu-Kai Chin.\\

  Next, HOL needed to know how to deal with the state machine transitions. TR_rules, TR_cases, and TR_ind
  are the three functions that were defined to do just this. These functions defined the behavior for
  each of the transition types: exec, trap, and discard. Thus, for the transition type exec, the rules
  was defined as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item If the following are true
  \begin{itemize}
  \item authentication test function for the input passes, and
    \item configuration test function for the configuration “passes”,
    \end{itemize}
  \item Then, define the following transition behavior for the exec command (note that this
    takes the secure state machine from configuration 1 to configuration 2)
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Configuration 1;
      \begin{itemize}
      \item authentication test function
      \item configuration test function
      \item security context list
      \item \lbrack someComand, next command, etc\rbrack \;(input list)
      \item Initial state
        \item Output
        \end{itemize}
      \item Configuration 2
        \begin{itemize}
        \item authentication test function
        \item configuration test function
        \item security context list
        \item \lbrack next command, etc\rbrack \;(input list without initial input)
        \item NS initial state (exec someCommand)
          \item Out output (exec someCommand)
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
  In essence, this definition told HOL how the configuration of the state machine changed from
  configuration 1 to configuration 2 given the transition type exec was followed by a specific
  command of type someCommand. Both explicit and implicit in the definition was the security context
  (security context list) with the proper authentications and authorities. The configuration test
  function includes the security context list as a parameter.\\

  The difference between the two configurations was defined by the NS (next state) and Out (next output)
  functions. These functions take the current state and current output, respectively, and return the
  next state and next output, respectively. NS and Out are the parameterizable functions. These are
  defined in each secure state machine definition “ssmNameScript.sml” that uses (“includes”) ssm11.
  In addition. the someCommand commands were define in the parameterizing secure state machine types
  definition file “nameTypeScript.sml”. Similar definitions were defined for the trap and discard
  transition types.
  
\subsection{Parameterization of the ssm11 Secure State Machine}
\label{sec:param-ssm11-secure}

The parametrizing secure state machines were implemented in two separate files. The first
file was the types definition file “nameTypeScript.sml” and the second file was the secure
state machine definition “ssmNameSctip.sml”. These are the parameterizing secure state machines,
not the parameterizable secure state machine ssm11. The did the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item nameTypeScript.sml
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Define the specific commands for each principal, the states for the state machine,
    the output, and the principals for the state machine.
  \end{itemize}
\item ssmNameScript.sml
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Define the next state relations
  \item Define the next output relations
  \item Define the authentication test function
  \item Define the state interpretation function
  \item Prove that commands without principals are rejected.
  \item Define the security context list
  \item Prove that a transition was made if and only if an authenticated and authorized
    principal gave the command. This often required one or more lemmas to prove. In addition,
    for multiple principals or different types of commands, more that one proof was needed.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
