\label{sec:design-conclusions}

PB operations were well defined by a state machine. The well-defined chain
of command, roles, and associated tasks yielded easily identifiable states
and sub states that have discrete beginning and ending points. Design
constraints inherent in state machines are manageable at this level of
granularity (i.e. top-level and sub state level).
