\ \\This file contains the datatype definitions used in ssmPB.\ \\
\begin{description}
\item[Datatype Definitions]\ 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Each state machine implements a set of types that are defined in OMNIType.
    OMNIType defines the datatype \textbf{command} which includes a constructor
    and type for \textbf{SLc slCommand}.
    \textbf{SLc} is the “state level command” constructor and the type is \textbf{slCommand}.
    slCommand is a type that is to be further defined in each state machine.\ \\
    \item Each state machine will implement a definition for \textbf{slCommand}.
    In PBType, this is defined as follows:
    \begin{align*}
      slCommand\; =&\;\; crossLD\ \\
                      &|\; conductORP\ \\
                      &|\; moveToPB\ \\
                      &|\; conductPB\ \\
                      &|\; completePB\ \\
                   &|\; incomplete
    \end{align*}
    There are 6 ssmPB commands.
    Except for \textbf{incomplete}, each command corresponds to a transition from one
    state to the next state.\textbf{incomplete} is a command that that does not
    change the state of the machine -- a “not done” command.\ \\
    \item Similarly, OMNIType defines the datatype \textbf{state} which has a “state level state”
      constructor and type \textbf{SLs slState}.  In PBType, \textbf{slState} is defined as follows:
      \begin{align*}
        slState\; =&\;\; PLAN\_PB\ \\
                      &|\; MOVE\_TO\_ORP\ \\
                      &|\; CONDUCT\_ORP\ \\
                      &|\; MOVE\_TO\_PB\ \\
                      &|\; CONDUCT\_PB\ \\
                   &|\; COMPLETE\_PB\ \\
      \end{align*}
    \item OMNIType defines the datatype \textbf{output} with the “state level output” constructor
      and type as \textbf{SLo slOutput}.  In PBType, it is implemented as follows:
      \begin{align*}
        slOutput\; =&\;\; PlanPB\ \\
                      &|\; MoveToORP\ \\
                      &|\; ConductORP\ \\
                      &|\; MoveToPB\ \\
                      &|\; ConductPB\ \\
                      &|\; CompletePB\ \\
                      &|\; unAuthenticated\ \\
      \end{align*}
    \item OMNITtype defines the datatype \textbf{principal} which has “state role” constructor and
      type \textbf{SR stateRole} as:
      \begin{align*}
        stateRole\; =&\;\; PlatoonLeader\ \\ \ \\
        \end{align*}
  \end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{General Notes}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item ssmPB is an acronym for “secure state machine patrol base”.  The “Script” notation
    tells HOL that this is to be implemented as a theory.  “.sml” is the standard
    file extension for poly ML type files.\ \\
  \item The importance of ssmPB is two-fold:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{It implements the top-level state machine in HOL.}
      \item \textit{It serves as a model for the implementation of subsequent state machines in the project.}\ \\
      \end{itemize}
    \item ssmPB uses ssm11 (secure state machine 1.1) as the general secure state machine which it
      parameterizes.  That is, functions and datatypes in ssmPB are used as parameters in the ssm11
      secure state machine.   ssmPB is the first state machine in the project that does this.  Thus,
      it is used as a model for subsequent state machines.  Because of the similarity of all state
      machines in the project, subsequent state machines can be a cut-n-paste adaptation of ssmPB,
      with appropriate updates of datatype names.  Encapsulation of each state machine facilitates
      the use of datatypes with the same name in different state machines.  Concerns about conflicts
      among datatype names while integrating state machines (if time allows) were discussed.  This
      should not pose a problem if time permits for the extension of the project to integration of
      state machines.\ \\
    \item iv.	Because ssmPB is a model for subsequent state machines, the details of ssmPB will
      be described in more detail than for subsequent state machine descriptions.\ \\
    \end{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Theory File Description}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item After the appropriate comments and declaration of ssmPB as a structure, HOL must open theories which it depends on.
