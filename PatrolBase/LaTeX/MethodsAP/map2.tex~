\label{sec:overall-approach}

The overall approach was to apply a hierarchy of \emph{secure} state machines to describe the patrol
base operations and verify them in the ACL and HOL.  To do this, it was focused on two things:
translating the patrol base operations from the Ranger Manual  into the hierarchy of state machines
and then verifying these in the access-control logic (ACL) using the Higher Order Logic (HOL)
theorem prover.  These two tasks are described separately in this section.

\section{The Hierarchy of \emph{Secure} State Machines}
\label{sec:hier-emphs-state}

We applied the principle of complete mediation to the patrol base operations using a hierarchy
of \emph{secure} state machines.  Our decision was guided by the following logic.  First, a hierarchy
of \emph{secure} state machines was a simple framework for abstracting the patrol base operations into
levels.  Each level added a layer of complexity.   Each layer of complexity included more details
about the patrol base operations.  Second, the hierarchy of \emph{secure} state machines was easy to
modularize.  Each level of abstraction was modularized and each \emph{secure} state machine within a
particular level was modularized.  Third, the principle of complete mediation was implicit in
the \emph{secure} state machine structure.    Finally, the hierarchy of \emph{secure} state machines could
build-off of previous HOL implementations.  A \emph{secure} state machine theory in HOL already existed
and was tested.   This was the ssm11 parameterizable \emph{secure} state machines.  We modified this
theory and used it.  \\

The patrol base operations were clearly defined in the Ranger Manual  and the security principles
were embedded within these definitions.  But, the patrol base operations were not defined with the
principle of complete mediation in mind.  To adapt the operations, we first abstracted them into six
states (or phases): planning state (PLAN_PB), move to the operational rally point (ORP) (MOVE_TO_ORP),
conduct ORP operations (CONDUCT_ORP), move to the patrol base (MOVE_TO_PB), conduct the patrol base
operations (CONDUCT_ORP), and complete the patrol base operations (COMPLETE_PB).  These six states
and the transitions among them comprised the top-level state machine. A first draft of the top-level
abstraction was shown in figure PHASES.\\
