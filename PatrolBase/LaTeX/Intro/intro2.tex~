The purpose of CSBD is to describe (1) how a system operates, (2) what security in terms of authentication
and authorization mean for envisioned scenarios in which the system operates, and (3) verify that the system
ConOps (Concept of Operations) satisfies the property of complete mediation. CSBD, until now, described
primarily electronic systems and protocols used in financial services.  Our goal in describing and analyzing
Patrol Base Operations is to see if CSBD can describe other kinds of systems where security and command,
control, and communications (C3) is crucial.\\

For our purposes, our system (patrol base) can be defined as such:

\begin{displayquote}
  \“A patrol base is a position established when a patrol halts for an extended period of time, by means of securing
  and occupying an appropriate location in order to (1) avoid detection, (2) hide, (3) maintain weapons and equipment,
  (4) eat and rest, (5) plan and issue orders, and (6) conduct operations [Ranger Manual, 5-30].\”
\end{displayquote}

The configuration of men and materiel changes throughout the various phases of patrol bases. Security is
constantly maintained throughout all configurations. We use CSBD to describe and verify patrol base configurations,
patrol base C3 for configuration changes/phases, and for verifying the security of C3 for each phase or configuration.
