We demonstrated that a non-automated system could be designed with the certified security
by design (CSBD) approach.  Our initial goal was two-fold: translate the patrol base operations
from the Ranger Manual into a structure to which the principle of complete mediation could be
applied and then to verify those structures using the access-control logic (ACL) and the Higher
Order Logic (HOL) theorem prover.  Once we decided on using a hierarchy of \emph{secure} state machines
to describe the patrol base operations, our goal became to complete a vertical slice through the
entire hierarchy.  This slice was to include translations of a vertical slice through the patrol
base operations and to verify that slice in the ACL and HOL.  Translation of the vertical slice of
the patrol base operations was completed.  The resulting hierarchy of \emph{secure} state machines was
translated into diagrams and can be found in the appendix .  Verification of the vertical slice
in ACL and HOL was completed up to the sub-level.  Non-verified aspects of the project were
discussed in the Future Work and Research.  Their verification is part of a master's thesis
project for one of the participants of this project.  \\

We found no significant impediments to our approach.  We considered several alternative ideas
for applying the CSBD approach to the patrol base operations.  But, no other method was worked
out in any detail worthy of inclusion in this documentation.  The only method that easily
integrated the principle of complete mediation without obfuscating the process was the hierarchy
of \emph{secure} state machines.\\

Overall, we consider this project to be a great success.  This success could be replicated with other non-automated systems.  In addition, non-automated systems are likely to be automated to some extent in the future--at least in accountability applications.  The techniques employed in this project are directly applicable to such projects where security and accountability of personnel and materials are critical to mission success.
