We recommend that the CSBD approach be considered for applying the principle of mediation
to this and other non-automated systems.  The hierarchy of secure state machines is also
recommended because it eases the translation of the non-automated system to a structure
wherein the principle of complete mediation can easily be applied.  We also recommend using
this approach when automating non-automated systems, for example in creating accountability
applications.  This is particularly useful for systems wherein accountability of personnel
and materials is critical to mission success.  Our recommendation is based on experiences
developed in this project and on one critical discovery...it works!
