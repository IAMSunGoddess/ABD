This project involved multiple people at multiple levels. The Principal Investigator was Professor
Shiu-Kai Chin of Syracuse University's Department of Engineering and Computer Science. Lori Pickering,
a Graduate Student at Syracuse University in the Department of Engineering and Computer Science,
focused on the verification of complete mediation using the access-control logic (ACL) and Higher
Order Logic (HOL) theorem prover.  Jesse Nathanial Hall, also a student at Syracuse University in
the iSchool and a Captain in the U.S. Army, was the subject matter expert. He translated the patrol
base operations into secure state machines.  YiHong Guo, an undergraduate at Syracuse University
in the Department of Engineering and Computer Science, worked diligently the documentation (and its numerous revisions).
